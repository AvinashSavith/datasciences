Error with X
[image]Hello. I had some errors, so just want to make sure that this version would be ok.1. I couldn't use dataset - my exel put everything in one column. So I inserted it manually. Is that fine?2. Also it was showing mistake with X (about the array). I made it with df.If those modifications change something very drastically or not? The output is the one that we were supposed to get anyway.Thanks. I am just curious.

Why is the weightage irrelevant in R?
In Python country was transformed to 3 columns due to ML applying weightage however in R it was kept as 1,2&3? Why is the weightage not a problem in R?

Question Details
 
Hello and welcome to this tutorial in the previous tutorial we learnt how to import the libraries.

And in this one we're going to learn how to import the data set.

So this time we're going to have to do it both in Python and our.

So let's start with Python.

I'm going to jump straight to Python.

Here we are.

OK.

So the first thing to do before starting to import a data set is of course to set a working directory

and that's the case any time you want to import the data set you have to specify a working directory

folder and that must be the folder that contains your data set.

So to send this folder as working directory it's very simple what you need to do is to go to File Explorer

here because this is the window where you can go to all the files in your computer.

So right now as you can see I'm on my desktop and this is the machine A-Z folder on my desktop.

So let's go inside inside just for that we have to parts and we are in part one data pre-processing

So let's open this subfolder.

Here we go.

And as for the content just one section let's open it.

And that is the folder we want to set as a working directory.

And why is that it because it contains the data.

Yes we file you know you can set any folder you want as working directory as long as they have the data

as he has before.

So once you reached this right folder in the file explorer window then you have two options.

For those of you who are working on a Mac while you have this little button here to set this folder

as a working directory and you just need to click on it as I just did.

And now this folder is set as a working directory.

So that's the first option.

If you have this little button here on your screen Well you can click on it to set the folder as working

directory and then for those of you who are on Windows then this option here might not work for you

.

So what you need to do is also very simple.

You just need to save your pipe and file it into the folder that contains the data set data.

That's easy.

And to save your life in fact you just need to click on here and if you did not say it before well you

will automatically have a window that will ask you to choose where to send your file and once despised

and file is saved in your folder that contains the data set data dots V.

Well what you need to do is simply click on this little button here which as you can see is to run the

whole file.

And that will automatically set your folder as working directory and actually there is a shortcut to

do it even faster.

It's instead of clicking on this button here you just need to press 5 and that will execute the whole

file and set your folder as working directory at the same time.

So you have the two options for Mac users you can click on this one year and for Windows users you save

your file in the folder that contains the data set and then you execute the saved file by pressing F5

.

Even if the file is empty and for both of you that will set your father as a working directory.

So as I explained in a previous tutorial the best library to import the data set is pandas.

So right now we're going to use pandas to import the data set.

We're going to declare a new variable that is going to be the data set itself and we going to simply

call it data sets.

OK.

Then equals and now immediately we will use spenda to import the data that says we did it.

So what we have to do is use the shortcut PD that is the shorthand for Penders.

Then you type dot and then read underscore C as we found this.

And in the parenthesis you input the name of your data set which is of course data that as we quote

parenthesis.

All good.

That's perfect.

So let's select this line here and press command control pass enter to execute.

OK.

As you can see in the count so the line of code was executed correctly so that means that we correctly

imported our data dataset and if we go to variable x for now here we can see that the dataset is actually

here.

And if we double click on it here is the dataset.

So we have our four columns country age salary per chased.

And we have our 10 observations.

So you have to understand that indexes in Python start at zero.

So here the first observation index is zero.

That's that's fine.

And that's where we're going to see that in our indexes at one.

But in Boston you have to get used to the fact that indexes start at zero.

So we have our 10 observations.

If you're not very comfortable with the scientific notation we can change that.

Actually I'm I would prefer you know the float number itself.

So we're going to click on format.

So here we're going to change the 3 to zero to have no decimal after the comma.

And we are going to change to g to F to have a float.

And when we click on OK we have our salary this way which some of you might prefer.

OK so we're fine with our data set.

Now let's click on OK.

And now there is something very important to understand in machine learning in Python it's that we have

a data set but we need to distinguish the matrix of features and the dependent variable vector.

So right now what we're going to do is we're going to create the matrix of features that if I go back

to my dataset here we are going to create the matrix of the three independent variables.

So basically we're going to put in a variable x there there's going to be the matrix.

All those observations here so basically the three cons here the three first columns which are the independent

variables columns and the 10 lines which are the 10 observations and then we will create the dependent

variable vector which is going to be the last column here with the 10 observations.

OK so let's do this let's click on OK and let's start by creating our matrix of features.

OK so we're going to call it X equals and then we're going to use the data set variable that we just

created then dot and we're going to take all the columns of features the columns of independent variables

and to do this we're going to type I like then brackets and then colon come up call them minus 1.

So don't worry about that.

I'll explain everything.

And then dart values.

Ok what did we just do here by putting the code in here.

That means that we take all the lines because what's on the left of this coming here is the lines of

the data set and what's on the right of this comma other columns.

So by putting this code in here that means that we take all the lines and then at the right of this

come up we typed call column minus 1.

So that means that we take all the columns except the last one minus one means that we don't include

the last one and column and so we take all the columns so column minus one means that we take all the

columns except the last one.

OK.

And that values means that we want to take all the values that just the Python syntax and that's how

it works.

So we're going to see.

Let's select this line and execute.

Here it is the X matrix was imported correctly.

And now let's stop here X in the council and as you can see we have our three first columns the three

first comes out of the dataset as you can see here the common country a salary country age salary.

And we don't have the last column purchased.

That's good that's our matrix that's the matrix of features of matrix of independent variables.

And you will understand step by step why we need to do this in python.

OK so I'm going to click on OK here and now what we have to do is to create the dependent variable vector

.

So we're going to call it.

Y equals.

And now we're going to do exactly the same thing.

So I'm going to copy this line here and paste it here.

And we want to take the last column so it's going to be the same.

We're going to take all the lines here with the cone here and here at the right of the comma.

Are going to choose the last column which is.

So we have two input here.

The index of the last column.

So let's go to our dataset and find what it is.

So as I said earlier indexes in Python start at zero.

So indexed for country is zero index for age is one index for salary is to an index pre-purchased is

3.

So here since we won the last column we're going to input three and we'll be fine.

Let's select this line come out of control plus enter to execute.

Here it is.

Here's the why let's type Y here and press enter.

And here it is we have our last call them.

No yes no.

This is the pre-Chase columns that I remind tell us if yes or no.

The customer.

But the product.

OK so that's it for Python.

We imported the data set and prepared the data correctly.

Now we're going to jump to our and see how we have to do it and you're going to see that it will be

much more simple because we won't have to make a distinction between the matrix of features and the

dependent variable vector.

So let's go to our.

OK.

So here I am on R and ask for python we need to set the working directory so to do this we have to go

to files here.

Here I'm on my desktop.

So let's go to our folder data pre-processing part 1.

Here it is Section 2 and this is the rifle that contains the data data that is we.

So this is the folder that you want to choose to set as a working directory.

And now to set this working directory on our you need to do one more thing you need to click on this

more button here and click on set as a working directory.

And here it is.

Now we know that this is the right working directory and we are ready to start importing the data set

.

OK so to do this in are what we need to do is very simple we will just need one line of code.

So as in Python we're going to call it data set.

So that's the variable that will be the data set itself.

And now we import a dataset is very easy to type read dot see as read.

And then in parenthesis you just type the name of your dataset in quotes.

So here you have to type data that C as V and that's it.

That's all you need to do.

So now we're going to select this line of code and execute OK.

So let's have a look at our data set to do this you just need to click here on the dataset and it just

displays here.

OK.

So we have our four columns.

Country age salary pre-Chase and R-Tenn. observations.

And what's interesting to see here is that unlike Python indexes don't start at zero but at one.

So that's why the first observations start at 1 here and ends at 10.

So that's the second section you have to understand between Python and are of course you don't have

to program on both.

You can choose the one you prefer.

But if you want to program on both as I usually do it's good to have this distinction in mind.

OK so we have already said it's all fine.

And as I just said here we don't have to make the distinction between a matrix of features and a dependent

variable vector.

And this will make perfect sense for you as we go along with this part 1 data pre-processing you'll

perfectly understand why next tutorials.

OK so that's it for the importing the data set step of the data preprocessing phase.

So that's it for this tutorial.

I look forward to seeing you in the next one which will be to learn how to take care of missing data

because sometimes your dataset will contain missing data and you have to take care of this.

And that's what we're going to learn in the next tutorial.

So I look forward to seeing you there.

And until then unjoin machine learning
